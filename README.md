This repository is the source code of the utility script that allows developers to easily add the Cardinal SDK to their existing projects.

It runs as a Cloudflare worker that, depending on the user agent, will output a Shell script that can be ran on the developer's machine.


## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started with using Cardinal, sign up for a Cardinal account via the [Dashboard](https://app.cardinal.run) and create your account.

> **Note**: Cardinal is currently in closed alpha and sign-up is invite-only.

Once you have created your account, you can use this installer to add the Cardinal SDK as a dependency to your project:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.cardinal.run | sh
```
